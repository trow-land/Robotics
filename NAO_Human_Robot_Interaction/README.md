# Socially Assistive Robots (SARs) as In-Home Personalised Exercise Instructors

## Abstract

With public health concerns such as rising obesity rates, an aging population, and a stretched healthcare system, the integration of Socially Assistive Robots (SARs) into daily exercise workouts presents a novel approach to in-home personalised exercise instruction. This project explores the use of a NAO robot, a small humanoid SAR, to lead participants through exercise routines and examines the impact of robotic demonstrations on the effectiveness of the instructions.

## Introduction

The uptake for regular physical exercise as a preventative health measure is hampered by the challenges many individuals face, such as access to professional training, confidence issues, and personal mobility limitations. SARs hold promise in overcoming these barriers by providing accessible exercise coaching, potentially alleviating pressure on healthcare systems by improving public health and aiding in-home rehabilitation efforts.

## Project Objectives

1. Evaluate the capability of SARs to guide individuals through simple exercise routines.
2. Investigate the impact of a robot's physical demonstration on the user's ability to correctly perform exercises.

## Methods

A comparative study was conducted with 16 participants engaging in two exercise routines led by a NAO robot. One routine included both verbal instructions and demonstrations, while the other offered verbal instructions only. Participants' feedback on their experience was collected through a questionnaire.

## Results

The inclusion of demonstrations by the NAO robot significantly improved the clarity of instructions, user motivation, and perceived safety during exercises. While the robot's instructions were deemed clear, participants expressed greater confidence and engagement when the robot provided a visual demonstration.

## Discussion

The study's outcomes suggest a promising role for SARs in exercise instruction, with demonstrations notably enhancing user experience. However, limitations such as the small and homogeneous sample size indicate a need for further research, particularly involving a more diverse participant group and a complex exercise routine.

## Conclusions

The findings support the potential for SARs to be employed as physical trainers, particularly if the robots are designed with enhanced degrees of freedom (DOF) for a broader range of demonstrations. Future studies should explore various modes of demonstration, enhanced feedback mechanisms, and the development of personalised routines.
